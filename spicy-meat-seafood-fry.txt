SPICY MEAT AND SEAFOOD FRY
(Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild)

Early in the game, as you explore the Great Plateau region, you encounter high-altitude areas you can't safely explore due to freezing temperatures. You need a warmer tunic, which the wandering woodcutter happily supplies if you prepare his favorite dish. That recipe also comes in handy later in the game, since there are plenty of other times you must venture into cold regions.

To prepare the dish the first time around, grab some of the peppers the woodcutter keeps in the cabin, then hunt down nearby wildlife. The boars in the Forest of Spirits are your best bet, if you can shoot one in the face with an arrow. Birds, which are easier to hit because they move around less, also serve the same purpose. To find the Hyrule Bass, check in the pond just downhill from the Shrine of Resurrection (the cave where Link appears at the start of the game). Stand on an island or bank and toss bombs at the water, then detonate them so the blast kills the fish before they can swim away from you.

Raw Meat (hunt in the Forest of Spirits area, located on the Great Plateau)
Hyrule Bass (look on the Great Plateau, in the pond near the Shrine of Resurrection)
Spicy Pepper (in the woodcutter's cabin on the Great Plateau, or in the Gerudo Desert or near the statues east of the Dueling Peaks stable)
